## Build

Talkie depends on [ncwrap](https://github.com/watermeloon1/ncwrap).

    $ make all

## Use

You have to start the talkie `./server` that starts listening on the port `6942` for incoming connections. After that you can start `./client`(s) on localhost. In the future there may be implementation for a full fetched networking system with lobbies and such.
